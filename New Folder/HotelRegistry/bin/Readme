1] Eclipse
	load project in eclipse and run the HotelRegistry.java file
	

2] Command line
	go to folder containing HotelRegistry.java file
	- run "javac HotelRegistry"
	- run "java HotelRegistry"   for machine run

1] HotelRegistry is implemented in three sections i.e. Modal, View and Controller.
   The Controller section comprises of the main method which will control the whole 
   flow of program. The Modal section consists of the core logic of getting the room
   information, checking room availability, managing room and guest information etc.
   Finally the View section comprises of all the GUI classes which will be used to
   display the Main menu window, Check-In, Check-out and Notification window.
   
2] I have implemented four different classes for all the four types of rooms. In 
   these classes i have declared the variables for getting info about Room no. , 
   No. of days the guest has stayed in that room and the charge per day of that type 
   of room.
   
3] Based on clerk's action and based on all the validations i am getting the room no.
   and setting the room no. using JComboBox.setModel method. and the same i am doing
   with the room no. in CheckOut form. And for the texts in Main Menu i am getting the 
   room no.s as text and updating the JTextFields on runtime based on the clerk's action.
   
[iii]
   I faced issues in implementing the logic for updating the Room no. in CheckIn window on
   runtime. Validating all the conditions and then displaying the room no. in JComboBox
   was giving me a hard time.
   
[iv]
   The issues i mentioned in point [iii] i have not implemented that properly. To be honest
   i am simply updating the room no.s in the CheckIn form based on the room type selected by 
   the Clerk.
    
[v]
   I am not sure about Vague or Open but i found that one important was missing in this
   whole project was the Billing information. After check out the receipt should have been
   generated based on the no. of days the customer stayed in that room. I tried to implement 
   that logic too but didn't implemented it fully. Otherwise, i might need to change the 
   layouts of the windows as given in the requirement.
   
[vi]
   I would give a 7 to this project. 
   I am giving this rating based on the time it took for me to complete this MP.
